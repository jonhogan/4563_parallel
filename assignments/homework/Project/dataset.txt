Rising up from a day of plunder
The ale of yesterday
Has gone down under
The battlefield awaits my soul
To Odin - For whom I wait
Thor guide me through my battles
Lead me home to Asgard
The victorious will rise
To the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

In the hour of final judgment
All Father, lead my way
When the fire of war reign
I will watch my brothers fall
Our names will be long forgotten
We live on forever
The victorious will rise
To the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

In the dust I swore my hatred
From seeing unborn children die
The mother's weeping wakes my sword
For vengeance
I thirst for blood

I ride into infinity
And as I fall I rise in Asgard
The victorious will rise
To the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil 


Wimps and posers beware
For true metal is here
Brothers and sisters you fear
For true warriors are everywhere

We forge our metal with pride
And honor the brave that die by our side
Together we stand in a fight
Heed our call
Warriors unite

We believe in metal
An army of warriors who fight by our side
All you need is metal
United in battle we reach for the sky

What we accomplish tonight
Shall echo in ages, in taverns they shout
The trial of the gods has brought us here
We know the ascension to Valhalla is near

We forge our metal with pride
And honor the brave that die by our side
Together we stand in our fight
Heed our call
Warriors unite

We believe in metal
An army of warriors who fight by our side
All you need is metal
United in battle we reach for the sky

Metal
We believe in metal
All you need is metal
We believe in metal
All you need is metal


So now we have gathered, with mead in our veins
We drink and we gamble we're screaming your names
Filling our horns for the gods and their reign
We're warriors of Valhalla, we'll rise again
The tavern is shaking, the barrels are drained
We're Brothers of metal

We're fucking we're fighting, we bleed
And we're never gonna fail before the sons of Odin

All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Hail my brother
All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Brothers of metal

As brothers arrive they are joining the feast
All brought from the battle by the Valkyries
And Saerimnir feeds every man, every beast
In life we would suffer, but here we are pleased
So drink brother, drink for the living deceased
We're brothers of metal

We're fucking we're fighting, we bleed
And we're never gonna fail before the sons of Odin

All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Hail my brother
All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Brothers of metal
